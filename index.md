<div class="lead intro">
  Hi! I’m **Clement Moron**, a [frontend architect](about/), [writer](articles/) and <span class="select-hide">not so</span> talented climber. I work as a nexus between design and frontend, [making websites](work/) scalable and lightning-fast.

  I like to build [cool things](projects/) in my spare time.

  I'm <span class="select-hide">crazy</span> passionate about my craft, always looking out for original ideas and new things. I'm drawn to anything that involves hiking, climbing or [traveling](https://vimeo.com/120206922).
