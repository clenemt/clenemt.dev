## A new kind of dashboard

A well designed dashboard should help you **grasp several info** at once while letting you find the data you seek quickly.{.lead}

It should be an **easy to read** interface, with focus on stability and predictability. No one likes fiddling around on excel-like spread sheets.

This kind of application can be found in solutions like [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/), [Google](https://www.google.com/dashboard/) or [Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com).

I was asked to work on a dashboarding solution that would **empower users** of Dassault Systemes solutions. The goal was to provide a *customizable* platform where users would be given access to a catalog of apps.

Apps would range from "progress report" to full "business applications".

Users where separated into *roles*, based on the [solutions](http://www.3ds.com/products-services/) they owned. Each *roles* were given a set of predefined dashboards and apps.

## Usefulness

Some of the **benefits** of this solution included:

* Visual presentation of performance measures
* Ability to identify and correct negative trends
* Saves time compared to running multiple reports
* Gain a global visibility on the system
* Align strategies and organizational goals

## Final thoughts

Definitely hire a designer a product owner and a UX designer. Having only engineers on the team is more often then not a recipe for complex and convoluted software. 😂
