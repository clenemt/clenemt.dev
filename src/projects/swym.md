# A bold enterprise social network

Imagine an organization that is completely digitally connected.

During my stay at Dassault Systemes, I was asked to participate in the development of an **in-house** enterprise social network. The goal was to start small then expand to other companies.

It seemed a **good idea at the time**, Facebook was racking up users by the millions and so everybody in the corporate world wanted a slice of the cake. Companies like [Yammer](https://www.yammer.com/), Jive, [Chatter](http://www.salesforce.com/eu/chatter/overview/), IBM or Microsoft jumped on the _bandwagon_ and so we did too.

But of course, all this was before the enterprise world realized that **the best tool for the job** was the one people where [already using](https://hbr.org/2015/04/why-no-one-uses-the-corporate-social-network).

Nonetheless we went on and built our own little social platform. It was called **Swym** and it worked quite well.

## Swym

Instead of being user centric like our competitors, we leaned towards **communities**. A user would join a number of communities and interact with them through posts, images, wikis, questions or simply by reading articles.

_The first iteration of the news stream._

All the communities he belonged to would be part of his news stream. He was then able to drill down inside any specific community.

## Features

Swym featured:

- Aggregated news feed
- A notification system
- A rich text editor (3d, image, videos, questions)
- Personal customizable spaces
- A site builder interface
- A per organization approach

## Tech

Swym was built using **Java** as a backend, a little bit of **node.js** for the notification systems and a lot of **javascript** on the front-end. It was mostly a _Single Page Application_ (SPA) built with an **in-house** javascript framework.

Many teams were involved throughout the journey and it was a fun project to be part of.
