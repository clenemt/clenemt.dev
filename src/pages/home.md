Hi! I’m **Clement Moron**, a [frontend architect](about), [writer](notes) and [not so]{.select-hide} talented climber. I work as a nexus between design and frontend, [making websites](projects/work) scalable and lightning fast.

I like to experiment and build [cool things](projects/open-source) in my spare time.

I'm [crazy]{.select-hide} passionate about my craft, always looking out for original ideas and _new things_. I'm drawn to anything that involves hiking, climbing or [traveling](https://vimeo.com/120206922).
