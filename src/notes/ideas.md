Ideas:
* move outside of dropbox
* windows terminal
* nvm
* Powertoys vs bloatted search bar
* ahk
* quicklook
* keyboard layout remapper
* inputrc

Windows for developer:
* clean install windows on partition (say no to all telemetrics)
* reboot as many times as windows updates are needed before changing anything
* install latest drivers from manufacturers (don't trust windows to do it)
* run privatezilla
* remove all windows bloat (default apps, one drive, cortana, windows optional features, right click menus, sidebar explorer)
* Go through the settings one by one a disable / edit all things needed (notifications, fake windows shut down, keyboard layout)
* Configure default folder options and quick access inside file explorer
* Keep the privacy map on for microsoft store to work
* Install apps: AHK, 1password, 7zip, git, icloud, firefox, nvm, powertoys, quicklook, spotify, vlc, windows terminal
